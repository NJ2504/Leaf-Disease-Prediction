The dataset is comprises of 87k RGB images spread across 338 different categories. The dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation. There is a seperate file directory consisting of 33 images. 

Code Desription:
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Network as the algorithm implemented using Tensorflow. The images are augmented using different techniques such as:
1. Rescale 
2. Rotation Range 
3. Width Shift Rnage
4. Height Shift Range
5. Shear Rnage
6. Horizontal Flip
7. Fill Mode

The model building comprises of using 3 Convolutional layers and Max Pooling Layer. Learning Curves and predictions are displayed.
