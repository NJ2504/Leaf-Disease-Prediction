The aim of the project is to identify plant leaf diseases over 36 different categories. 
The dataset consists of over 80k images and they are already split into training and validation. 
Convolutional Neural Network and MaxPooling layers are used for this project.
The dataset is further expanded using several augmentation techniques.
